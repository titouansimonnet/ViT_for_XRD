# ViT_for_XRD
## Abstract  
We propose to use Vision Transformers (ViT) [1] to identify and quantify mineral phases from X-Ray diffraction patterns.
[2] Our work was published for the 2025 ICASSP Conference.

Jupyter Notebook and databases are available to train the ViT. Our trained models are also available.  
Jupyter for Attention Rollout and Positional encoding for identification problem are also available.
