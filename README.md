# ViT_for_XRD
## Abstract  
[1] This work was published for the 2025 ICASSP Conference.  
We propose to use Vision Transformers (ViT) [2] to identify and quantify mineral phases from X-Ray diffraction patterns.

Jupyter Notebook and databases are available to train the ViT. Our trained models are also available.  
Jupyter for [Attention Rollout](https://jacobgil.github.io/deeplearning/vision-transformer-explainability) and Positional encoding for identification problem are also available.
