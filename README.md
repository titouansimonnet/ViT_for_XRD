# ViT_for_XRD
## Abstract  
This repository contains the materials for the paper [1] presented at the 2025 ICASSP conference, which follows on from our previous work [2].
We propose to use Vision Transformers (ViT) [3] to identify and quantify mineral phases from X-ray diffraction patterns.
Jupyter notebook and databases are available for training the ViT. Our trained models are also available.
Jupyter Notebook for Attention Rollout and Positional Encoding [3] for the identification problem are also available.
